#### About me: 

My programming journey really starts in 2019 when I first touched coding. I instantly fell in love with it and decided I would pursue it in my spare time. Since then my passion for programming has only grown. Since I knew this is what I wanted to do in life I started looking at bootcamps and found App Academy to which I applied as soon as I could honestly. One of my better decisions for sure as I have been able to grow as a developer and meet people like myself.
